# 🎓 AI Assistant Usage in Student Life

This is a portfolio project built on **10,000 sessions of AI Assistant usage by students**.  
I used **Excel + Power BI (DAX, Power Query)** and presented it through **Notion + GitHub**.

## 💡 Key Insights  
- AI has already become a day-to-day study helper — over 3/4 of sessions end with a positive outcome.  
- Short, focused sessions (5–10 minutes, 2–3 prompts) work best.  
- Practical tasks (Writing, Coding) are completed successfully more often than open-ended ones (Research, Brainstorming).  
- 71% of students return to AI after their first try.
